# Artanis 2D Engine

This private repository contains my own Monogame 2D Engine.

## Getting Started

In order to use this on your project, you need to either add the DLL as reference or add the whole solution inside your monogame project. In both cases you need to use the correct using statement in each file:
```
using Arta2DEngine;
```

### Prerequisites

This engine uses Monogame 3.7.1. It might work on other versions, but it is not tested against any other than 3.7.1.

### Installing

Simply cloning this repository inside a folder of your choice with:

```
git clone https://github.com/Artanisx/Arta2DEngine.git
```

Then add the project to your solution, then add it as a reference to your main game project.
